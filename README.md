# Rupert's devnotes

This is a repository of my working developer notes as I solve problems and come upon solutions, or document my thinking and discoveries about software.

I've also included lists of useful tools and some checklists that I go back to.

YMMV, I provide this publicly in case it is useful to others, but assume no responsibility for use.
