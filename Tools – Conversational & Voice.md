# Voice AI tools
- [[Rasa AI]] – Most user friendly for a developer. Easily lay out stories in yaml for the AI to learn from. Looks like it can also tackle the functionality of MindMeld. This is my choice.
*  [MindMeld](https://www.mindmeld.com/)  – Feature rich: knowledge base, question answering, and conversational flows. More complex.

Other options:

*  [BotPress](https://botpress.com/)  – Decent GUI and self-hosted, but I prefer Rasa for text-based flows
*  [Deep Pavlov](https://github.com/deepmipt/dp_notebooks)  – Looks a little complex
*  [Convlab](https://github.com/ConvLab/ConvLab)  – More research-based
